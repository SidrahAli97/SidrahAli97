- 👋 Hi, I’m Sidrah Ali, a new data analyst who recently completed her Google data analytics certification 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... cats, autumn, reading, cooking, working out and floral design! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... to brush up on my skills with SQL, Tableau, Python, and how to make a good steak. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to just make new connections!
